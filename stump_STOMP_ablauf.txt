STOMP (line explanation):
1: specify $T$, $m$
2: Compute Mean and StandardDeviation for each subsequence in T with length $m$
3: SlidingDotProduct Vector $QT_{first}$ from first subsequence $T_1,m$ and all other subsequences from T (for fast convolution, FFT is used)
4: CalculateDistanceProfile $D_1$ for first subsequence $T_{1,m}$ with: $d_{1,j}$ for all $j$ 1 to $n-m+1$
5: Initialize MatrixProfile $P$ and MatrixProfileIndex $I$
6: Looping through the Time Series $T$ starting at position $i=2$ and going upwards
    7: Looping through the Time Series $T$ starting at position $j=l$ and going downwards
        8: Update $QT[j]$ with the new algorithm that uses $QT[j-1]$
    10: Set $QT[1]$ to $QT_{first}[i]$
    11: CalculateDistanceProfile $D_i$ for subsequence $T_{i,m}$ with: $d_{i,j}$ for all $j$ 1 to $n-m+1$
    12: Compare every element of MatrixProfile $P$ with $D_i$. If the value in $D_i[j]$ < $P[j]$, update $P[j]$ with $D_i[j]$ and set $I[j]=i$
14: Return MatrixProfile $P$ and MatrixProfileIndex $I$
